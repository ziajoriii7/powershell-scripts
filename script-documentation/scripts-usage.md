# scripts-usage

it intends to be useful to my github markdown files especially
it should accomplish ALL of the following requisites:
- if the file doesn't exist it creates it, if it already exist it just appends at the first line the header (it doesn't overwrite)
- the name of the header depends on if it's a README.md file or not
-- if it is a README.md file it gets the name from the parent folder
-- if it's other name it gets the header with filename (without its extension)
